Assignment 3 of the Advanced Artificial Intelligence Course
===========================================================

The assignment consists of 1) a knowledge check on delete relaxation heuristics, and 2) implementation
of a few algorithms that use these ideas.

The heuristics at hand are implemented within the fast-downward planner, under `search/planopt_heuristics`.
